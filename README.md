# Tolkien Ipsum
## What's more fun than effectively useless websites, ya know?

I have been using the Bob Ross Ipsum recently and this weekend I got into a conversation with one of my wife's coworker's boyfriends and we realized we both _love_ the Lord of the Rings universe. Fast forward twenty minutes and we realized there is not Tolkien Ipsum.

### So I made one.
